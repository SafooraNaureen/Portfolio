      <title>Project 1: Concrete Compressive Strength by Regresssion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>The conventional process of testing the compressive strength of concrete involves casting several cubes for the respective grade (M10, M15 etc.) and observing the strength of the concrete over a period of time ranging from 7 to 28 days. Various combinations of the components of concrete are selected and cubes for each combination are casted and its strength at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days is noted down. This is a time consuming and rather tedious process.</description>

      <title>Project 2: Data Scientists&#39; Salary Estimation</title>
      <link>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 11:00:59 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-2/</guid>
      <description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 14K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job
  Scraped over 700 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
  Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, R, excel, sql, spark, tableau, aws and hadoop
  Used Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Support Vector and Random Forest Regressors to reach the best model.</description>

      <guid>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-3/</guid>
      <description>Created a model which predicts the percentage of marks students can acquire given the number of hours they study using Linear Regression with 95% accuracy.
  Created a Flask server and website to deploy the Machine Learning Model on local server.
  Created Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2 Instance(Ubuntu) to deploy the model on Ubuntu server.
  Created a private key for the project using PuTTygen for uploading the model.</description>

      <guid>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-4/</guid>
      <description>This projects aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks to identify cat and dog images after training and testing on a data containing 10,000 images of cats and dogs.
  Applied Convolutional Neural Networks and built a model to identify cats and dogs using keras tensorflow.
  Deployed the model as a website on local machine using flask and html.
  Python Version: 3.8
Packages: pandas, numpy, keras, tensorflow, flask, json, html.</description>

      <guid>https://safooranaureen.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-5/</guid>
      <description>This project aims to do a sentiment analysis of the reviews of customers who visited a the restaurant using Natural Language Processing and Bag of Words for feature extraction.
  Used Naive Bayes Classification algorithm to separate Positive and Negative Sentiments for better business world understandings.
